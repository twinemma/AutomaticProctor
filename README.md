This repository contains the code for our project: Automated Online Proctoring Using Gaze View Tracking and Custom Object Detection

# Abstract

Due to COVID-19, there’s been a burst in online examinations. The main integrity safeguard so far is human proctoring, which requires a trained supervisor to constantly monitor each test-taker's video and audio. To overcome its costliness and ineffectiveness, we have designed an automated online proctoring system that is effective, non-intrusive, and adaptable to different testing scenarios. Our approach presents a novel combination of (a) gaze view tracking using a mathematical 3D gaze motion formula and (b) configurable cheating classification using a custom-trained object detection model. Our gaze view tracking leverages two cameras (a webcam and a follower-cam) working in tandem and facial landmark detection to follow the test-taker’s gaze in a real-time and non-intrusive manner, and then feed to our cheating classification that leverages an AI-based image detection algorithm to identify pre-configured cheating targets. Our end-to-end experimental setup and trials demonstrate an effective complement system to thriving distance learning.
